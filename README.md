# 61D Course Drawings

Most diagrams used in 61D are created using [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) which is a free and open source browser-based sketching tool. There is a paid plan for hosting drawings, but .excalidraw files can be exported and imported for free.

Additionally, excalidraw offers free read only view links. This allows you to zoom and pan around the drawings and view them in a more ergonomic way than zooming in on a screenshot.

However, editing a uploading and editing a drawing and then exporting it will generate a "new" link for the "new" drawing. 

This repo stores the drawing files, so that they can be edited in excalidraw, and the most recent version can be accessed by the read only view link. After editing a drawing, also update the link in the README.
